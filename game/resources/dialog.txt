Hey engineer, I need you to fix the lights on the about page
It's been broken for the longest time, and they need to be reprogrammed
The lights should match the sequence on the picture behind me
But our blasted server has an ancient architecture and he can't make it work within the restrictions of the machine
If you could, help my useless intern write some C code
Think you can solve my riddle!
I have the file safely kept in my ssh server running under my bridge on port 8084.
I dare you to solve it! Only then will I let my neighbours cross my bridge.
And that's saying something, cause I hate my neighbours.
Wow! You actually got the darn thing to work.
Thanks for your help! Yer a life saver!
Since you helped, feel free to make the light look anyway you like.
With your code, we can always fix it now anyway. Go crazy!
my username is "troll" and my password is "bridgelover47".
ssh troll@localhost -p 8084
*whispered in binary*
Well, seems like you actually managed to solve my riddle.
Guess that means I have to be nice to my neighbours now *sigh*.
