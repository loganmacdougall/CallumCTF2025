Hey engineer, I need you to fix the lights on the about page
It's been broken for the longest time, and they need to be reprogrammed
The lights should match the sequence on the picture behind me
But our blasted server has an ancient architecture and he can't make it work within the restrictions of the machine
If you could, help my useless intern write some C code
Think you can solve my riddle!
It's somewhere on our website. I'm sure you'll find it
Go ahead and try, only then will I let my neighbours cross my bridge
And that's saying something, cause I hate my neighbours
Wow! You actually got the darn thing to work
Thanks for your help! Yer a life saver!
Since you helped, feel free to make the light look anyway you like.
With your code, we can always fix now anyway. Go crazy
