Hey engineer, I need you to fix the lights on the about page
It's been broken for the longest time, and they need to be reprogrammed
The lights should match the sequence on the picture behind me
But our blasted server has an ancient architecture and he can't make it work within the restrictions of the machine
If you could, help my useless intern write some C code
